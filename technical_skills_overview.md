# Skills Overview

This file provides an overview of the **technical** and **non-technical** skills applied in this project.

## ðŸ”¹ Technical Skills

### **Data Processing & Statistical Analysis**
- **Descriptive Statistics** â€“ Analysing dataset characteristics (e.g., BMI distribution, meal frequency, snacking habits).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identifying relationships between dietary patterns and obesity using correlation analysis and visualisations.  
- **Feature Engineering** â€“ Creating BMI as a continuous variable for improved classification.  

### **Machine Learning & Predictive Modelling**
- **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group individuals based on eating habits.  
- **SHAP Analysis** â€“ Understanding the impact of individual features on obesity classification.  
- **Supervised Learning** â€“ Training and evaluating models:  
  - **Random Forest** (highest accuracy at 97%)  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**  
  - **Decision Trees**  
  - **Logistic Regression**  

### **Programming & Data Handling**
- **Python** â€“ Primary language for data processing and machine learning.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Developing and documenting analysis workflows.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and numerical computations.  
- **Scikit-learn & XGBoost** â€“ Model training and evaluation.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Visualising trends and patterns.  
- **SHAP** â€“ Feature importance analysis.
