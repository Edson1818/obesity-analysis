# Obesity Analysis
## Summary

This project explores the estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical activity, using statistical analysis, clustering techniques, and supervised learning models. The study investigates whether obesity can be accurately predicted from lifestyle factors and identifies the most influential variables contributing to weight classification.

Statistical analysis involves examining numbers and trends to understand relationships between different factors. In this project, it helps us see how eating habits and physical activity relate to obesity levels. For example, it can show whether people who eat fewer vegetables are more likely to be overweight.

Clustering is a method used to find groups of people who have similar behaviours. In this case, it helps identify groups based on their diet and exercise habits. For example, it can separate people into categories like "healthy eaters with regular exercise" and "frequent snackers with little exercise." This allows us to understand different risk levels for obesity.

Supervised learning involves training a computer to recognise patterns and make predictions. Here, we use past data to teach a model how to classify individuals into different obesity levels based on their habits. Once trained, the model can predict a personâ€™s obesity risk just by looking at their diet and activity details.

Each of these methods helps in understanding obesity trends, grouping people based on their habits, and making predictions about who is at riskâ€”offering valuable insights for health interventions.
